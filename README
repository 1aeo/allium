tor-metrics: statically generated tor metrics and statistics

  tor-metrics generates a set of HTML documents which represent the total set
  of tor relays at runtime, sorting by ASN/country/platform/flag, respectful
  Onionoo queries (If-Modified-Since) and 100% certified Javascript-freeâ„¢

  demo: https://yui.cat/

  $ ./generate.py
  $ ls ./www
  all.html  as  country  family  flag  index.html  platform  relay  static
  $

  TODO
  - top exit/guard/relay families (see https://nusenu.github.io/OrNetStats/)
  - interesting statistics (ASN exit concentration, IPv6-supporting relays)
  - implement something similar to https://metrics.torproject.org/bubbles.html
  - generalize sorting functions, avoid redundancy

  note: this project includes country flags from GoSquared[0] and relay flags
  from the Tor Project[1]; licenses are included in this project's root
  directory
