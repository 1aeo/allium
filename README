Tor Metrics :: https://yui.cat/ source
* Relay listings statically generated at runtime
* Sort by family, ASN, country, and platform
* Respectful Onionoo requests (If-Modified-Since)
* Javascript-free

TODO:
* Top exit/guard/relay families (see https://nusenu.github.io/OrNetStats/)
* Interesting statistics (ASN exit concentration, IPv6-supporting relays)
* Implement something similar to https://metrics.torproject.org/bubbles.html
* Generalize sorting functions, avoid redundancy
