allium: statically generated tor metrics and statistics - https://yui.cat/

  allium generates a set of HTML documents which represent the total set of tor
  relays at the time of execution

  allium is heavily inspired by the official tor metrics project[0] and serves
  as a javascript-free, statically-generated clean room implementation. the
  primary goals of the project are to be fast (static), use few API queries
  (one), and to present information in a condensed, readable format

  TODO
    - top exit/guard/relay families (see https://nusenu.github.io/OrNetStats/)
    - interesting statistics (ASN exit concentration, IPv6-supporting relays)
    - implement something similar to https://metrics.torproject.org/bubbles.html

  note: this project includes country flags from GoSquared[1] and relay flags
  from the Tor Project[2], the licenses of which are included in this project's
  root directory
