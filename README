TODO:
    * Top exit/guard/relay families (see https://nusenu.github.io/OrNetStats/)
    * Interesting statistics (ASN exit concentration, IPv6-supporting relays)
    * Implement something similar to https://metrics.torproject.org/bubbles.html

This project includes country flags from https://github.com/gosquared/flags and
relay flags from https://www.torproject.org/
