## 🎯 Ready for Phase 2

Phase 1 is complete and **approved for Phase 2**. Next phase will:

1. **Create active status documents**:
   - `development/performance.md` (current perf status)
   - `development/security.md` (current security status)

2. **Archive historical details**:
   - Move completed performance reports to `archive/performance-details/`
   - Move completed security audits to `archive/security-details/`

3. **Validation**:
   - Check-in for approval before Phase 3

**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes  
**Risk Level**: LOW (moving files to archive, creating summaries)

2. AROI leaderboards are **complete and operational**
3. Network health dashboard **confirmed present**
4. Directory authorities page **confirmed present**
5. Documentation structure **ready for content migration**
