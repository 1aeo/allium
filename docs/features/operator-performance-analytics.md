# Operator Performance Analytics

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fully Implemented  
**Core System**: AROI Leaderboard + Contact Performance Analysis  
**Implementation**: `allium/lib/aroileaders.py` (1,212 lines) + Contact analytics  

## Overview

The Operator Performance Analytics system provides comprehensive performance tracking, benchmarking, and competitive analysis for Tor relay operators. Through the Autonomous Relay Operator Identification (AROI) system, operators are accurately identified and ranked across 15+ performance categories, creating a complete picture of network contribution and operational excellence.

## System Architecture

### **AROI Foundation**
#### **Operator Identification**
```python
# Accurate operator grouping via contact information:
# - Contact hash-based aggregation
# - AROI domain extraction (ContactInfo specification)
# - Relay family configuration analysis
# - Duplicate prevention and accuracy verification
```

#### **Performance Calculation Engine**
```python
# allium/lib/aroileaders.py - Core calculation system
def _calculate_generic_score(operator_relays, data, time_period, metric_type):
    """Generic scoring for different metrics (reliability, bandwidth)"""
    
def _format_bandwidth_with_auto_unit(bandwidth_value, bandwidth_formatter):
    """Automatic unit determination for optimal display"""
```

### **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**
The system evaluates operators across five core dimensions:

1. **Capacity & Performance** - Bandwidth contribution and consensus weight
2. **Network Roles** - Exit and Guard operator specialization  
3. **Diversity & Geography** - Global reach and infrastructure diversity
4. **Reliability & Stability** - Uptime performance and consistency
5. **Innovation & Leadership** - Platform diversity and veteran status
