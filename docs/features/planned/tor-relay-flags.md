### 2.3 Architecture Overview

> As of 2026-02-15, `relays.py` was refactored from ~5,900 lines into 8 focused modules.
> The consensus evaluation pipeline (`collector_fetcher.py`, `consensus_evaluation.py`) was **not** affected.

| Module | Lines | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `relays.py` | ~1,100 | Core relay class, Onionoo fetch, consensus evaluation call |
| `page_writer.py` | ~1,020 | HTML page generation |
| `network_health.py` | ~1,300 | Network statistics and health metrics |
| `operator_analysis.py` | ~1,350 | Operator/contact analysis |
| `categorization.py` | ~750 | Relay categorization |
| `flag_analysis.py` | ~380 | Flag uptime analysis |
| `ip_utils.py` | ~94 | IP address utilities |
| `time_utils.py` | ~118 | Time formatting utilities |

**Consensus evaluation pipeline:**
1. `collector_fetcher._analyze_flag_eligibility()` → per-authority eligibility
2. `consensus_evaluation._format_relay_values()` → aggregated stats + relay values
3. `consensus_evaluation._format_flag_requirements_table()` → pre-computed row dicts
4. Template iterates `diag.flag_requirements_table` rows directly

## 3. Complete Flag Reference

### 3.1 Core Eligibility Flags

#### Valid

**Purpose:** Basic eligibility — relay must have Valid flag to be used by clients.

**Requirements:**
```
1. Running a Tor version NOT known to be broken
2. NOT blacklisted as suspicious by the authority
3. Has valid descriptor with acceptable address
```

**Operator Relevance:** HIGH — Without Valid, relay cannot be used at all.

#### Running

**Purpose:** Proves relay is online and reachable.

**Requirements:**
```
1. Authority successfully connected to relay's ORPort within last 45 minutes
2. Must pass reachability test on ALL published ORPorts:
   - IPv4 ORPort (required)
   - IPv6 ORPort (if relay advertises one AND authority has AuthDirHasIPv6Connectivity 1)
```

**Operator Relevance:** CRITICAL — Without Running, relay is not in consensus.

### 3.2 Performance Flags

#### Stable

**Purpose:** Indicates reliable uptime for long-lived connections (SSH, IRC, etc.)

**Requirements (meet EITHER):**
```
Option A: Active AND Weighted MTBF ≥ median for known active routers
Option B: Active AND Weighted MTBF ≥ 7 days
```

**Disqualifying Conditions:**
- Running Tor 0.1.1.10-alpha through 0.1.1.16-rc (dropped circuits)

**Operator Relevance:** HIGH — Required for Guard eligibility.

#### Fast

**Purpose:** Indicates sufficient bandwidth for general use.

**Requirements (meet EITHER):**
```
Option A: Active AND bandwidth in top 7/8ths for known active routers
Option B: Active AND bandwidth ≥ 100 KB/s (AuthDirFastGuarantee)
```

**Operator Relevance:** HIGH — Required for Guard eligibility.

### 3.3 Role Flags

#### Guard

**Purpose:** Entry point to Tor network — needs high reliability.

**Requirements (ALL must be true):**
```
1. Has Fast flag
2. Has Stable flag
3. Weighted Fractional Uptime (WFU) ≥ median for "familiar" active routers
4. Is "familiar" (1/8 of all active nodes appeared more recently, OR around for a few weeks)
5. Bandwidth ≥ AuthDirGuardBWGuarantee (2 MB/s default) OR in top 25% fastest
6. Has V2Dir flag
```

**Operator Relevance:** CRITICAL — Most desired flag, significant traffic and network impact.

#### Exit

**Purpose:** Can relay traffic to regular internet.

**Requirements:**
```
Allows exits to at least one /8 address space on BOTH:
- Port 80
- Port 443
```

**Operator Relevance:** HIGH — Determines if relay is exit node. Legal implications.

#### HSDir

**Purpose:** Hidden Service Directory — stores .onion descriptors.

**Requirements (ALL must be true):**
```
1. Stores and serves v2 hidden service descriptors
2. Has Stable flag
3. Has Fast flag
4. Authority believes uptime ≥ 96 hours (MinUptimeHidServDirectoryV2)
```

**Operator Relevance:** MEDIUM — Supports hidden services, no special requirements beyond stability.

#### V2Dir

**Purpose:** Can serve directory information to clients.

**Requirements (meet EITHER plus cache condition):**
```
Option A: Has open directory port (DirPort)
Option B: Has tunnelled-dir-server line in router descriptor

AND: Running Tor version with supported directory protocol
AND: Not disabled with "DirCache 0"
```

**Operator Relevance:** MEDIUM — Required for Guard flag. Most modern relays have this automatically.

### 3.4 Authority Flag

#### Authority

**Purpose:** Identifies Directory Authority relays.

**Requirements:** The authority generating the network-status believes it's an authority.

**Operator Relevance:** N/A — Only assigned to the 9 directory authorities.

### 3.5 Negative and Warning Flags

#### BadExit

**Purpose:** Marks misbehaving exit nodes.

**Assignment:** Listed on authority's "bad exit" list.

**Reasons:** Traffic manipulation, SSL stripping, content injection, DNS manipulation.

**Operator Relevance:** CRITICAL (negative) — Relay is not used for exit traffic.

#### MiddleOnly

**Purpose:** Restricts suspicious relays to middle position only.

**Assignment:** Authority believes relay unsuitable for use except as middle relay.

**Effects when assigned:**
- Removes: Exit, Guard, HSDir, V2Dir
- Adds: BadExit (if that flag exists in consensus)

**Added:** Tor 0.4.7.2-alpha

**Reasons:** Suspicious behavior patterns, Sybil risk indicators, policy violations not severe enough for full removal.

**Operator Relevance:** CRITICAL (negative) — Significant restriction on relay usage.

#### StaleDesc

**Purpose:** Warns about outdated relay descriptor.

**Requirements:** Descriptor's published time is >18 hours old.

**Operator Relevance:** MEDIUM — Indicates relay may have connectivity issues.

#### Sybil

**Purpose:** Sybil attack detection/mitigation.

**Requirements:** Authority sees >2 relays on same IP (AuthDirMaxServersPerAddr).

**Effects:** Removes Running and Valid flags from excess relays.

**Operator Relevance:** HIGH — If running multiple relays on same IP, only 2 will be in consensus.

### 3.6 Consensus and Deprecated Flags

#### NoEdConsensus

**Purpose:** Ed25519 key identity uncertainty. Applied in consensus computation, not voted by authorities.

**Operator Relevance:** LOW — Usually indicates temporary consensus issues.

#### Named / Unnamed (Deprecated)

No longer assigned by authorities.

## 4. Current Allium Implementation Details

### 4.1 Eligibility Flag Vote Details Table

The table uses `_format_flag_requirements_table()` to pre-compute all row data in Python.

| Flag | Rows | Metrics Tracked | Data Sources |

## 5. Implemented Flag Details

### 5.1 Exit Flag (✅ Implemented 2026-02-15)

**Layers implemented:**

| Layer | File | What |
|-------|------|------|
| 1 | `collector_fetcher.py` | `eligibility['exit']` per-authority flag tracking |
| 2 | `consensus_evaluation.py` | `'exit'` in `_format_flag_summary()` loop |
| 3 | `consensus_evaluation.py` | `_analyze_exit_policy()`, `_port_in_rules()`, exit values in `_format_relay_values()` |
| 4 | `consensus_evaluation.py` | Exit row in `_format_flag_requirements_table()` |
| 5 | `relay-info.html` | Exit Policy row in Summary table |
| 6 | `relay-info.html` | Exit column in Per-Authority Details table |
| Caller | `relays.py` | Passes `exit_policy_summary` to `format_relay_consensus_evaluation()` |

**Data Flow:**
```
Onionoo (exit_policy_summary) + CollecTor (vote flags)
  → relays.py passes exit_policy_summary
  → collector_fetcher tracks per-authority Exit flag
  → consensus_evaluation analyzes exit policy (ports 80+443)
  → Template: Eligibility table (1 row) + Summary table + Per-Auth column
```

**Verification:** Full build comparison (21,700+ HTML files) showed zero unintended changes from Exit implementation.

### 5.2 MiddleOnly Flag (✅ Implemented 2026-02-16)

**Design:** MiddleOnly is a **negative/warning flag** (like BadExit), not an eligibility metric. It uses conditional display — rows/warnings only appear when the relay actually has the flag.

**Layers implemented:**

| Layer | File | What |
|-------|------|------|
| 1 | `collector_fetcher.py` | `eligibility['middleonly']` per-authority flag tracking |
| 2 | `consensus_evaluation.py` | `'middleonly'` in `_format_flag_summary()` loop |
| 3 | `consensus_evaluation.py` | `middleonly_flagged`, `middleonly_count` in `_format_relay_values()` |
| 4 | `consensus_evaluation.py` | Conditional MiddleOnly row in `_format_flag_requirements_table()` |
| 5 | `relay-info.html` | Warning in Health Status, conditional row in Summary table |
| 6 | `relay-info.html` | MiddleOnly column in Per-Authority Details table |
| Diagnostics | `relay_diagnostics.py` | MiddleOnly issue detection (like BadExit) |

**Key Differences from Exit:**
- No numeric thresholds — authority discretion only
- Conditional display — hidden for 99.9% of relays
- Warning treatment — red warning, not eligibility tracking
- Per-Auth shows "—" by default, "Yes" (red) only when flagged

---

## 6. Implementation Complete

All 5 operator-relevant flags are now fully implemented in the eligibility table:

| Priority | Flag | Implemented | Rows |
|----------|------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Exit | 2026-02-15 | 1 row (Exit Policy) |
| 2 | MiddleOnly | 2026-02-16 | 0-1 rows (conditional) |
| 3 | V2Dir | 2026-02-16 | 1 row (Dir Capability) |
| 4 | Running | 2026-02-16 | 1-2 rows (IPv4 + conditional IPv6) |
| 5 | Valid | 2026-02-16 | 1 row (Tor Version) |

Remaining flags (Authority, BadExit, StaleDesc, Sybil, NoEdConsensus) are display-only or internal flags that don't benefit from eligibility table rows.
