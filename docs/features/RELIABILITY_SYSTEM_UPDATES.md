# Reliability System Updates

## Overview

This document describes the recent updates to the Allium reliability scoring system for the **Reliability Masters** and **Legacy Titans** categories. The changes simplify the scoring mechanism and add eligibility requirements to ensure statistical significance.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Simplified Scoring Algorithm**
- **Previous**: Complex bandwidth-weighted reliability calculation
- **Current**: Simple average uptime calculation
- **Formula**: `reliability_score = sum(relay_uptime_percentages) / number_of_relays`

### 2. **25+ Relay Eligibility Filter**
- **Requirement**: Only operators with more than 25 relays are eligible
- **Rationale**: Ensures statistical significance in uptime calculations
- **Impact**: Filters out small operators while maintaining focus on established operators

### 3. **Removed Bandwidth Weighting**
- **Previous**: Multipliers based on relay count (1.0x, 1.1x, 1.2x, 1.3x)
- **Current**: No weighting applied - all relays count equally
- **Benefit**: Simplified system focusing purely on uptime consistency

## Implementation Details

### Category Definitions

#### Reliability Masters (6-Month Uptime)
```
Title: "Reliability Masters (6-Month Uptime, 25+ Relays)"
Emoji: ⏰
Eligibility: > 25 relays
Timeframe: 6-month average uptime
Data Source: Onionoo Uptime API (1_month field)
```

#### Legacy Titans (5-Year Uptime)
```
Title: "Legacy Titans (5-Year Uptime, 25+ Relays)"
Emoji: 👑
Eligibility: > 25 relays
Timeframe: 5-year average uptime
Data Source: Onionoo Uptime API (1_year field)
```

### Scoring Examples

#### Eligible Operator (30 relays)
```
Relays: 30 (eligible: > 25)
Individual relay uptimes: [98.2%, 96.8%, 97.5%, ..., 95.9%]
Average: 96.8%
Final Score: 96.8% (no weighting applied)
Display: "96.8% avg (30 relays)"
```

#### Ineligible Operator (15 relays)
```
Relays: 15 (ineligible: ≤ 25)
Status: Excluded from reliability rankings
Reason: Insufficient sample size for statistical significance
```

### Code Implementation

#### Filtering Logic
```python
# Filter operators with > 25 relays for reliability categories
reliability_masters_filtered = {
    k: v for k, v in aroi_operators.items() 
    if v['total_relays'] > 25
}
```

#### Score Calculation
```python
def _calculate_reliability_score(operator_relays, uptime_data, time_period):
    # Simple average calculation (no weighting)
    average_uptime = sum(uptime_values) / len(uptime_values)
    score = average_uptime  # No multiplication factor
    
    return {
        'score': score,
        'average_uptime': average_uptime,
        'weight': 1.0,  # Always 1.0 (no weighting)
        'relay_count': len(operator_relays),
        'valid_relays': len(uptime_values)
    }
```

## Display Changes

### Leaderboard Position
- **Previous**: Positions 6-7 (middle of leaderboard)
- **Current**: Positions 11-12 (end of leaderboard)
- **Rationale**: Reliability metrics moved to end after core network metrics

### Tooltip Format
```
Previous: "6-month reliability: 95.2% × 1.3 weight = 123.8% (250 relays)"
Current:  "6-month reliability: 96.8% average uptime (30 relays)"
```

### Table Display
```
Previous: "123.8% weighted (250 relays)"
Current:  "96.8% avg (30 relays)"
```

## Benefits of Changes

### 1. **Simplified Understanding**
- Clear, straightforward average uptime calculation
- No complex weighting factors to explain
- Easier for operators to understand their scores

### 2. **Statistical Significance**
- 25+ relay threshold ensures meaningful sample sizes
- Reduces noise from single-relay operators
- Focus on established operators with proven infrastructure

### 3. **Pure Reliability Focus**
- Scores reflect actual uptime performance
- No bandwidth bias affecting reliability metrics
- Fair comparison across all eligible operators

### 4. **Reduced Complexity**
- Simplified codebase without weighting calculations
- Cleaner display format without multiplication symbols
- Easier maintenance and testing

## Migration Impact

### Operator Impact
```
Small Operators (≤25 relays):
- Previous: Included with 1.0x weight
- Current: Excluded from reliability rankings
- Alternative: Can still compete in other 10 categories

Large Operators (>25 relays):
- Previous: Complex weighted scores
- Current: Simple average uptime scores
- Benefit: Cleaner, more understandable metrics
```

### System Impact
```
Code Complexity: Reduced
Display Clarity: Improved  
Statistical Validity: Enhanced
User Understanding: Simplified
```
