# Relay Detail Page Layout Changes

## Overview

The relay detail page has been reorganized to provide better information hierarchy and user experience. These changes improve the logical flow of information while integrating new features like flag uptime display and bandwidth measurement indicators.

## Key Layout Changes

### 1. Information Hierarchy Reorganization

#### New Information Flow
The page now follows a logical progression from technical specifications to network addresses to location information:

1. **Technical Specifications** (Top Priority)
   - Bandwidth details with measurement indicators
   - Network participation probabilities
   - Performance-related data

2. **Network Addresses** (Secondary)
   - OR Address (with hostname verification)
   - Exit Address
   - Directory Address

3. **Location and Network Information** (Tertiary)
   - Geographic location (City, Region, Country)
   - Autonomous System information
   - Network topology details

4. **Network Function and Reliability** (Operational)
   - Flags and capabilities
   - Flag uptime (new feature)
   - Overall uptime statistics
   - Operational status

5. **Historical Information** (Reference)
   - First/last seen dates
   - Restart history
   - Configuration changes

#### Before vs After Layout

**Before** (Mixed priority levels):
```
Nickname, Fingerprint, AROI, Contact
IPv4/IPv6 Exit Policy, Exit Policy, Family Info
OR Address, Exit Address, Dir Address
Country, AS, Flags
Uptime, Seen dates, Last restarted
Bandwidth (at bottom)
```

**After** (Logical hierarchy):
```
Nickname, Fingerprint, AROI, Contact
Bandwidth + Measurement Indicators
Network Participation
OR Address, Exit Address, Dir Address  
Country, AS, Geographic details
Flags + Flag Uptime (new)
Overall Uptime + Statistical analysis
Seen dates, Last restarted
IPv4/IPv6 Exit Policy, Family Info
```

### 2. Bandwidth Measurement Indicators

#### New Visual Indicators
Bandwidth measurements now include status indicators to show measurement quality:

- **✓ (Green)**: Bandwidth measured by ≥3 bandwidth authorities
- **✗ (Red)**: Bandwidth not measured by ≥3 bandwidth authorities  
- **? (Gray)**: Bandwidth measurement status unknown

#### Implementation Details
```html
{% if relay['measured'] is not none -%}
    {% if relay['measured'] -%}
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: #28a745; font-weight: bold;" 
                         title="Bandwidth measured by ≥3 bandwidth authorities">✓</span>
    {% else -%}
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;" 
                         title="Bandwidth not measured by ≥3 bandwidth authorities">✗</span>
    {% endif -%}
{% else -%}
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: #6c757d;" 
                     title="Bandwidth measurement status unknown">?</span>
{% endif -%}
```

#### Tooltip Integration
The indicators include hover tooltips explaining the measurement status, providing educational value for users unfamiliar with Tor's bandwidth measurement process.

### 3. Flag Uptime Integration

#### New Flag Uptime Section
A dedicated section for flag-specific uptime has been added above the general uptime section:

```html
<dt title="Flag-specific uptime percentages showing the reliability of this relay when operating in its primary network role">
Flag Uptime (1M/6M/1Y/5Y)
</dt>
<dd>
{% if relay.get('flag_uptime_display') and relay['flag_uptime_display'] != 'N/A' -%}
    {% if relay['flag_uptime_display'] == 'Match' -%}
        <span title="{{ relay['flag_uptime_tooltip']|escape }}">Match Overall Uptime ({{ relay['uptime_api_display']|safe }})</span>
    {% else -%}
        <span title="{{ relay['flag_uptime_tooltip']|escape }}">{{ relay['flag_uptime_display']|safe }}</span>
    {% endif -%}
{% else -%}
N/A
{% endif -%}
</dd>
```

#### Display Logic
- **Match Overall Uptime**: When flag uptime closely matches general uptime, display "Match Overall Uptime" with actual values
- **Specific Values**: When flag uptime differs significantly, show flag-specific percentages
- **Tooltips**: Include detailed tooltips explaining flag priority and calculation methodology

### 4. Improved Visual Hierarchy

#### Section Spacing
- Consistent spacing between related sections
- Clear visual separation between different information categories
- Better alignment of labels and values

#### Typography Improvements
- Consistent font weights for section headers
- Improved readability through better contrast
- Standardized tooltip styling

#### Color Coding Integration
- Consistent color scheme across all uptime displays
- Standardized styling for measurement indicators
- Improved accessibility through proper contrast ratios

## Technical Implementation

### Template Structure Changes

#### Reorganized Template Sections
The `relay-info.html` template has been restructured with clear section boundaries:

```html
<!-- Technical Specifications Section -->
<dt>Bandwidth (Observed | Advertised | Rate | Burst)</dt>
<dd><!-- Bandwidth with measurement indicators --></dd>

<dt>Network Participation (Consensus Weight | Guard | Middle | Exit)</dt>
<dd><!-- Network participation probabilities --></dd>

<!-- Network Addresses Section -->
<dt>OR Address</dt>
<dd><!-- OR address with hostname verification --></dd>

<!-- Location Information Section -->
<dt>Country</dt>
<dd><!-- Geographic and AS information --></dd>

<!-- Network Function Section -->
<dt>Flags</dt>
<dd><!-- Flag display --></dd>

<dt>Flag Uptime (1M/6M/1Y/5Y)</dt>
<dd><!-- Flag-specific uptime --></dd>

<dt>Uptime (1M/6M/1Y/5Y)</dt>
<dd><!-- Overall uptime --></dd>
```
