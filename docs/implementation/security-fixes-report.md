# Security Fixes Applied to AROI-Leaderboard

## Overview
This document summarizes the security fixes applied to address HTML injection (XSS) vulnerabilities in the aroi-leaderboard application.

## Critical Fix Applied

### 1. Enabled Jinja2 Autoescape (CRITICAL)
**File:** `allium/lib/relays.py`
**Change:** Added `autoescape=True` to the Jinja2 Environment configuration

```python
ENV = Environment(
    loader=FileSystemLoader(os.path.join(ABS_PATH, "../templates")),
    trim_blocks=True,
    lstrip_blocks=True,
    autoescape=True  # Enable autoescape to prevent XSS vulnerabilities
)
```

**Impact:** This single change automatically escapes ALL template variables by default, providing comprehensive XSS protection across the entire application.

## Template-Specific Fixes

### 2. Fixed relay-info.html
**Changes:**
- Added `|escape` to relay nickname in title: `{{ relay['nickname']|escape }}`
- Added `|escape` to relay nickname in header: `{{ relay['nickname']|escape }}`
- Added `|escape` to all OR addresses: `{{ address|escape }}`

### 3. Removed Double-Escaping in Templates
Fixed templates that were pre-escaping variables during assignment, which would cause double-escaping with autoescape enabled:

**Files affected:**
- `as.html` - Removed `|escape` from `as_number` and `as_name` variable assignments
- `country.html` - Removed `|escape` from `country_orig` and `country_abbr` variable assignments  
- `platform.html` - Removed `|escape` from `platform_name` variable assignment

## Security Analysis Results

### Before Fixes
- **610 potentially unescaped variables** detected across 19 template files
- Jinja2 autoescape was **disabled**, requiring manual escaping of every variable
- High risk of XSS through relay nicknames, AS names, platform names, etc.

### After Fixes
- Autoescape enabled globally - **all variables are now automatically escaped**
- Manual escaping preserved in URL contexts for proper URL encoding
- No dangerous `|safe` filters found
- No inline JavaScript contexts found
- Defense in depth achieved with both automatic and manual escaping

## Remaining Considerations

While the critical vulnerabilities have been addressed, the following should be monitored:

1. **New Templates**: Any new templates added will automatically benefit from autoescape
2. **URL Encoding**: URLs already have proper manual escaping with `|escape`
3. **Future Development**: Developers should avoid using `|safe` filter unless absolutely necessary
4. **Testing**: The application should be tested to ensure no display issues from the escaping

## Verification

You can verify the fixes by running:
```bash
python3 check_template_escaping.py
```

The script will still show some "vulnerabilities" but these are now protected by autoescape:
- Function calls like `navigation()` - safe
- Numeric values - cannot contain XSS
- Variables in attributes - protected by autoescape

## Conclusion

The aroi-leaderboard application is now protected against HTML injection attacks through:
1. **Global autoescape** - preventing XSS by default
2. **Proper URL encoding** - already implemented in templates
3. **No unsafe filters** - no bypasses for autoescape
4. **Clean architecture** - no inline JavaScript to worry about

The application now follows security best practices for Jinja2 templating.
