## üèÖ Weighted Country Scoring System

Countries are dynamically classified using a sophisticated scoring system with geopolitical awareness:

### Scoring Formula
```
Rarity Score = (Relay Count Factor √ó 4) + 
               (Network Percentage Factor √ó 3) + 
               (Geopolitical Factor √ó 2) + 
               (Regional Factor √ó 1)
```

### Factor Details

**1. Relay Count Factor (Weight: 4x)**
- 6 points: 0 relays
- 5 points: 1 relay  
- 4 points: 2 relays
- 3 points: 3 relays
- 2 points: 4 relays
- 1 point: 5 relays
- 0 points: 6+ relays

**2. Network Percentage Factor (Weight: 3x)**
- 6 points: <0.05% of network
- 4 points: 0.05-0.1% of network
- 2 points: 0.1-0.2% of network
- 0 points: >0.2% of network

**3. Geopolitical Factor (Weight: 2x)**
- 3 points: Conflict zones (Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, etc.)
- 3 points: Authoritarian regimes (China, Iran, North Korea, etc.)
- 2 points: Island nations (Malta, Cyprus, Iceland, etc.)
- 2 points: Landlocked developing countries (Kazakhstan, Mongolia, etc.)
- 1 point: General developing countries
- 0 points: Developed countries

**4. Regional Factor (Weight: 1x)**
- 2 points: Underrepresented regions (Africa, Central Asia, Pacific Islands)
- 1 point: Emerging regions (Caribbean, Central America, South Asia)
- 0 points: Well-represented regions

### Country Classifications
- **Legendary (15+ points)** - Ultra-rare countries with critical strategic importance
- **Epic (10-14 points)** - Very rare countries with high geopolitical significance  
- **Rare (6-9 points)** - Uncommon countries worth prioritizing
- **Emerging (3-5 points)** - Countries with potential for growth
- **Common (0-2 points)** - Standard countries with good representation
