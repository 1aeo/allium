# Implementation Reports Archive

This directory contains **completed implementation reports** - detailed technical documentation of features that have been successfully implemented and deployed.

## 📋 Purpose

These reports provide historical context for:
- How features were implemented
- Technical decisions and trade-offs
- Challenges overcome during implementation
- Validation and testing results
- Before/after comparisons

## 🔍 Using These Reports

**When to Reference**:
- Understanding why implementation choices were made
- Learning from past technical decisions
- Troubleshooting related to historical features
- Preparing new features in similar areas
- Documenting lessons learned

**These are NOT**:
- Current feature specifications (see `docs/features/`)
- Active implementation guides (see `docs/development/`)
- Architecture docs (see `docs/architecture/`)

## 📅 Archive Policy

Reports are archived when:
1. ✅ Implementation is complete and deployed
2. ✅ Feature is verified working in production
3. ✅ No active development on that specific implementation
4. 📚 Historical context is valuable for future reference
