# Documentation Archive

This directory contains **historical documentation** - completed work, past reports, and archived materials that provide context but are no longer actively maintained.

## 📂 Structure

### [implementation-reports/](implementation-reports/)
Completed implementation reports and technical write-ups for features that have been delivered.

**Purpose**: Historical record of how features were implemented, decisions made, and challenges overcome.

### [performance-details/](performance-details/)
Detailed performance optimization reports and benchmarking results from past optimization work.

**Purpose**: Historical context for performance improvements, useful for understanding optimization decisions.

### [security-details/](security-details/)
Historical security audit reports and vulnerability assessments that have been addressed.

**Purpose**: Record of security improvements, useful for compliance and understanding security evolution.

## 🎯 Purpose of Archiving

Documentation is archived when:
1. ✅ **Work is Complete** - Feature implemented, optimizations applied, security issues fixed
2. 📊 **Context Preserved** - Implementation details saved for future reference
3. 🧹 **Active Docs Simplified** - Current documentation focuses on present state and future plans
4. 📚 **Historical Value** - Information useful for understanding project evolution

## 📋 What's NOT Archived

- **Current Status Documents** - Active performance/security guidelines remain in `development/`
- **Active Proposals** - Future plans remain in `features/planned/`
- **Living Documentation** - Architecture and API docs stay current
- **User Guides** - User-facing docs always current

## 🔍 Finding Archived Documents
