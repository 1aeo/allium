## Key Schema Improvements

### Time-Series Focus
The improved schema treats Tor network data as time-series data with:
- **Hourly snapshots** of every relay's state from consensus documents
- **Change tracking** for nicknames, IPs, ports, and flags over time
- **Lifecycle analysis** including first seen, last seen, restarts, and IP changes
- **Historical aggregations** by operator, AS, country, and version

### Core Tables Structure

1. **relay_status_series** - Main time-series table with hourly relay status
2. **authority_measurements** - Per-authority views and measurements
3. **bandwidth_measurements** - Detailed bandwidth authority scanner results
4. **relay_descriptors** - Extended relay information (contact, family, platform)
5. **relay_extra_info** - Statistical data (connection stats, exit traffic by port)
6. **geoip_data** - IP geolocation enrichment table

### Materialized Views for Fast Analytics

1. **relay_lifecycle** - Tracks relay history, restarts, IP changes
2. **network_health_hourly** - Network-wide statistics and trends
3. **operator_metrics_daily** - Operator performance aggregations
4. **as_metrics_daily** - AS-level concentration and diversity
5. **country_metrics_daily** - Geographic distribution analytics

   - Achievement recognition system with historical leaderboards
   - Comparative analysis with network averages over time

2. **For Tor Project**:
   - Network health monitoring with anomaly detection
   - Trend analysis for strategic planning
   - Early warning system for network issues
   - Data-driven decision making with historical context

3. **For Researchers**:
   - 18+ years of network evolution data
   - Geographic and political correlation analysis
   - Network resilience studies
   - Decentralization progress tracking

## Implementation Approach

The proposal follows a phased approach:
- **Weeks 1-4**: Data ingestion pipeline setup
- **Weeks 5-8**: Core analytics development
- **Weeks 9-12**: Visualization integration
- **Weeks 13-16**: Advanced features and ML models

## Technical Stack
- **Database**: ClickHouse (columnar OLAP database)
- **Ingestion**: Python async pipeline with parallel processing
- **Visualization**: Chart.js/D3.js for interactive graphs
- **Caching**: Redis for query result caching
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for data access

## Sample Queries

### Relay Performance History
```sql
SELECT 
    consensus_time,
    nickname,
    consensus_flags,
    consensus_weight,
    concat(toString(ip), ':', toString(or_port)) as address
FROM relay_status_series
WHERE fingerprint = 'YOUR_RELAY_FINGERPRINT'
ORDER BY consensus_time DESC;
```

### Top Operators by Contribution
```sql
SELECT
    contact,
    sum(relay_count) as total_relays,
    sum(total_bandwidth) as bandwidth_contributed
FROM operator_metrics_daily
WHERE date >= today() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY contact
ORDER BY bandwidth_contributed DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the improved time-series schema
2. Set up development ClickHouse instance
3. Begin historical data collection from collector.torproject.org
4. Implement data ingestion pipeline with new schema
5. Prototype visualizations using materialized views
6. Gather operator feedback on analytics priorities
