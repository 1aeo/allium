- **Memory Usage**: ~400MB during processing
- **Usage**: Primary data source for relay listings, geographic analysis, operator metrics

**Sample Data**:
```json
{
  "relays": [{
    "fingerprint": "9695DFC35FFEB861329B9F1AB04C46397020CE31",
    "nickname": "moria1",
    "running": true,
    "flags": ["Authority", "Fast", "Running", "Stable"],
    "consensus_weight": 27,
    "country": "us",
    "platform": "Tor 0.4.8.7 on Linux",
    "observed_bandwidth": 20971520
  }]
}
```

### Onionoo Uptime API  
- **URL**: `https://onionoo.torproject.org/uptime`
- **Purpose**: Historical uptime statistics and flag history for reliability analysis
- **Memory Usage**: ~2GB during processing (large historical dataset)
- **Usage**: Enhanced relay reliability metrics and performance analysis

**Sample Data**:
```json
{
  "relays": [{
    "fingerprint": "9695DFC35FFEB861329B9F1AB04C46397020CE31",
    "uptime": {
      "1_month": "978",
      "1_year": "945"
    },
    "flags": {
      "Running": {"1_month": "987", "1_year": "954"},
      "Guard": {"1_month": "974", "1_year": "943"}
    }
  }]
}
```

**Performance Features**: Parallel API fetching, HTTP conditional requests, graceful fallback to cached data

## üìã Usage & Configuration

```bash
./allium.py [options]
```
