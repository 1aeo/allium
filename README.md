# Tor Metrics :: [yui.cat](https://yui.cat/) source

Network-oriented Tor metrics and statistics made with love (not javascript).

* No javascript
* Static HTML/CSS generation at runtime
* Minimal library dependence (jinja2, requests)
* Sort by ASN, country, and platform
* Respectful Onionoo queries (If-Modified-Since)

```
TODO:
- Per-relay page generation (display contact, exit policy, etc)
- Sort by effective family, show member count globally
- Interesting statistics (ASN exit concentration, IPv6-supporting relays, etc)
- Neat network-related graphs
```

This project includes country flags by [GoSquared](https://github.com/gosquared/flags) and relay flags by the [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/).
