# ClickHouse Historical Analytics Proposal for Allium
*Enhancing Tor Relay Analytics with Time-Series Intelligence*

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy to integrate ClickHouse database with the allium Tor relay analytics platform to provide historical data analysis, trend visualization, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection. By ingesting CollecTor consensus weight files from 2007 to June 2025, we can create a powerful historical analytics engine that significantly enhances the current real-time monitoring capabilities.

## üìä Current State Analysis

### Existing Allium Capabilities
- **Real-time analytics** from Onionoo API (refreshed every 30 minutes)
- **12 AROI leaderboard categories** with current rankings
- **Network health dashboard** with instant metrics
- **Static analysis** of current relay states
- **Geographic and platform diversity** analysis
- **Bandwidth and consensus weight** current measurements

### Current Limitations
- **No historical trending** - only current snapshots
- **No pattern analysis** over time
- **No anomaly detection** capabilities
- **Limited time-series data** (only basic uptime from Onionoo)
- **No historical leaderboards** or ranking changes
- **No bandwidth evolution** tracking
- **No seasonal pattern** recognition
