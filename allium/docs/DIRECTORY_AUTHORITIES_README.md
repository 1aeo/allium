# Directory Authorities Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the Directory Authorities page for the Allium project.

## Overview

The Directory Authorities page provides comprehensive monitoring of Tor directory authorities, including:
- Health metrics and consensus participation
- Uptime statistics with z-score analysis
- Network and geographical information

**Note:** Version compliance monitoring is commented out until real consensus-health API data is available.

## Files Created/Modified

### Core Implementation
- `lib/relays.py` - Added directory authority processing methods and general uptime data fetching
- `templates/misc-authorities.html` - Main template for the authorities page with ch? placeholders for version compliance
- `templates/macros.html` - Updated navigation to include authorities page
- `allium.py` - Added call to generate authorities page

### Testing
- `test_authorities.py` - Comprehensive test suite for authority functionality (version compliance test disabled)
- `test_template_rendering.py` - Template rendering and edge case tests updated for new attribute structure

## Data Sources

### Real-Time Data (Onionoo API)
- **Authority Details**: Extracted from main relay data (`self.json['relays']`) by filtering for "Authority" flag
  - Basic information: nickname, fingerprint, running status
  - Network details: AS number, country, platform, version
  - Contact information and timestamps
  
- **Uptime Data**: `https://onionoo.torproject.org/uptime` - **Fetched for ALL relays during initialization**
  - Historical uptime data for 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years
  - Merged into each relay object as `uptime_data` field
  - Used for directory authority uptime analysis and z-score computation
  - **Available for future relay uptime features**

### Placeholder Data (Future Implementation)
- **CollecTor API** (`ct?` prefix in template): 
  - Last vote timestamps from consensus documents
  - Bandwidth measurement data from bandwidth files
  
- **Consensus Health** (`ch?` prefix in template):
  - Real-time consensus metrics
  - Relay coverage statistics per authority
  - Consensus age and failure rates
  - **Version compliance tracking** (currently shows placeholders)

## Key Features

### Health Metrics Summary
- ~~Version compliance tracking~~ (replaced with ch? placeholders until real data available)
- Uptime analysis with statistical outlier detection
- Overall network health indicators

### Authority Table
- **Status Monitoring**: Online/offline status with last seen timestamps
- **Network Info**: AS number, provider name, country with flag icons
- **Performance**: Multi-period uptime with color-coded z-scores
- **~~Compliance~~**: Version checking with ch? placeholders
- **History**: First seen and last restarted dates

### Visual Indicators
- **Color-coded z-scores**: Green (good), yellow (normal), red (problematic)
- **Problem highlighting**: Authorities with issues shown in red (based on uptime and running status)
- **Status icons**: Online (ðŸŸ¢) / Offline (ðŸ”´) indicators

## Implementation Details

### Data Processing (`lib/relays.py`)

#### Enhanced Initialization Flow
1. **`_fetch_onionoo_details()`** - Fetches relay details for all relays
2. **`_fetch_onionoo_uptime()`** - **NEW: Fetches uptime data for ALL relays and merges into relay objects**
3. **Processing methods** - Work with the complete dataset (details + uptime)

#### `_fetch_onionoo_uptime()`
- **Architectural improvement**: Fetches uptime data for all ~7000 relays upfront
- Merges uptime data into each relay object as `uptime_data` field
- Provides foundation for future relay uptime analysis features
- Handles network errors gracefully with empty uptime data fallback
- **Performance**: Single uptime API call instead of targeted calls

#### `_process_directory_authorities()`
- Filters directory authorities from already-fetched relay data
- **Uses stored uptime data** from `relay['uptime_data']` instead of making separate API calls
- Calculates average uptime percentages for multiple periods
- Computes z-scores for uptime comparison
- Sorts authorities alphabetically for consistent display
- **Cleaned up**: Only includes fields actually used in template (removed unused or_addresses, dir_address)
- **Version compliance**: Commented out until real consensus-health data available

#### `_calculate_average_uptime(uptime_data)`
- Processes Onionoo uptime data format
- Handles missing values and converts to percentages
- Returns None for invalid/missing data

#### `write_misc()` - Directory Authorities Integration
- **Detects `misc-authorities.html` template** and automatically processes directory authorities
- **No separate function needed**: Directory authorities processing integrated directly into standard workflow
- Stores authority data and summary as class attributes for template access
- Calculates summary statistics for uptime analysis (version compliance disabled)
- **Consistent with other misc pages**: Uses same rendering pipeline as families, networks, contacts, etc.

### Template Structure (`templates/misc-authorities.html`)

#### Summary Section
- Consensus health overview (with `ch?` placeholders)
- Directory authority metrics summary
- **Version compliance**: ch? placeholders instead of real data
- Uptime analysis with real z-score data

#### Main Table
- Comprehensive authority information using real Onionoo data
- **Version compliance column**: ch? placeholder instead of computed values
- Placeholder columns for future CollecTor/consensus-health data

#### Template Access Pattern
- Uses `relays.authorities_data` instead of separate `authorities` variable
- Uses `relays.authorities_summary` for summary statistics
- Consistent with other Allium template patterns via `write_misc()`

### Statistical Analysis

#### Z-Score Calculation
- Based on 1-month uptime compared to all authorities
- Used to identify outliers and problematic authorities
- Thresholds:
  - Above +0.3: Above average (green)
  - -0.5 to +0.3: Normal range (yellow)
  - Below -2.0: Problematic (red)

#### ~~Version Compliance~~ (Disabled)
- ~~Compares authority versions against recommended version~~
- **Replaced with ch? placeholders** until consensus-health integration
- Will use real recommended version data when available

## Architectural Benefits

### Current Improvements
- **Reduced API calls**: Single uptime call for all relays vs. targeted authority calls
- **Better performance**: One network request instead of multiple
- **Data consistency**: All relay data fetched at same time
- **Cleaner code**: Uses standard `write_misc()` method, no custom template handling
- **Optimized data**: Only stores fields actually used in template
- **Better separation**: Real data vs. placeholder data clearly marked

### Future Extensibility
The comprehensive uptime dataset enables future features:
- **Relay uptime analysis pages**: Compare uptime across relay types
- **Uptime-based sorting/filtering**: Sort relays by reliability
- **Network health metrics**: Overall network uptime statistics
- **Relay comparison tools**: Side-by-side uptime comparisons
- **Historical trend analysis**: Uptime changes over time

## Testing

### Unit Tests (`test_authorities.py`)
- **Data Processing**: Uptime calculation and z-score computation
- **Network Handling**: Sequential API calls (details + uptime) and error scenarios
- **Integration**: Full workflow testing with merged uptime data and write_misc usage
- **Edge Cases**: Missing uptime data and invalid responses
- **Version Compliance**: Test disabled (commented out) until real data available

### Template Tests (`test_template_rendering.py`)
- **Compilation**: Template syntax validation
- **Rendering**: Output with new attribute structure (`relays.authorities_data`, `relays.authorities_summary`)
- **Edge Cases**: Empty data and None values
- **Structure**: HTML validity and content checks

## Usage

### Generation
The authorities page is automatically generated when running allium.py:

```bash
python3 allium.py --out ./www --onionoo-url https://onionoo.torproject.org/details
```

### Output
- File: `./www/misc/authorities.html`
- Navigation: Accessible via "Directory Authorities" menu item
- Updates: Refreshes every 30 minutes with new Onionoo data
